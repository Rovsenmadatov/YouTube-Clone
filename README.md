# API

This project is a YouTube clone project. The data received from the API has been used properly. It is a project that I made until the mini player opens when the mouse navigates to the VideoCards on the home page. In addition, you can use the search section as you wish and access the videos. Also, the project has been implemented in a responsive structure.
